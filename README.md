# Sanjeevni Sutra

**Sanjeevani Sutra** is a wearable first aid guidance system that empowers anyone to provide life-saving assistance in emergencies. It combines a smart glove, multi-sensor finger device, and VR-guided instructions to monitor vital signs, diagnose conditions, and offer real-time first aid guidance, enabling untrained individuals to act quickly and effectively.

**Sanjeevani Sutra** won us the second price in a government organised district level science fair.
